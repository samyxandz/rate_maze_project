# rate_maze_project
project consisting of raze maze solver allocated to  Tamaghna Choudhuri in Introduction to programming class in first semester of batchelor of engineering 
,computer science engineering.


## introduction

A Maze is given as N*N binary matrix of blocks where source block is the upper left most block
i.e., maze[0][0] and destination block is lower rightmost block i.e., maze[N-1][N-1]. A rat starts
from source and has to reach the destination. The rat can move only in two directions: forward and
down. Write a program to simulate the game with a 6Ã—6 maze as given below. Rat will start from
S (selected randomly in each game). In case of termination of movement before reaching the
destination (E), the rat will be allowed to return back to the previous position and take new move.
Your system will list down and display the movements of the rat (you can use file to write all
movements.
